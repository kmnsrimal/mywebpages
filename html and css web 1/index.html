                <br>
                <h1>WE ARE WAITING FOR YOU!</h1>
                <p>Tip: Make sure you are well versed with
                     the company's achievements, stating
                      those achievements in relevant field
                       can have a better impression 
                       e.g.: Educational field.

                    Well, there are many reasons why I want
                     to join your company. However one of the
                      major reason for my desire to work for 
                      your company is that your firm has 
                      indeed set a benchmark in the field of
                       education. I am indeed highly impressed
                        with the “XYZ” project, which has 
                        become a case study for professionals 
                        like me & has been following exemplary
                         work which your firm has worked on.
                          I feel with my experience, the type
                           of groundbreaking work your organization
                            has put forward, I would be able to confidently
                             chip in the best of my knowledge in future projects
                              for your company.</p>
